##Background

Buzzin' Bee is a Javascript game inspired by Jetpack Joyride. It features Barry, a bee on the run! The player will be able to fly up and down using the spacebar. But be careful! There will be oncoming nets trying to catch him. If he gets caught, it will end the game. Collect the honey on the way for points! Yum!
